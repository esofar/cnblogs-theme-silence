							<!--开始：文章主题 -->
							<p>As I read through Aaron Gustafson’s <a href="#">Beyond
							<code>DOCTYPE</code>: Web Standards, Forward Compatibility, 
							and <span class="caps">IE8</span></a>, my immediate 
							gut reaction was deeply negative. The version-targeting 
							mechanism Aaron described was just wrong, completely 
							backwards, the exact opposite of what we ought to be 
							doing. Every one of my instincts, honed over a decade-plus 
							of web development, was in opposition.</p>
							<p>Why did I react that way? Partly because version 
							targeting looked like the revenge of <a href="#">browser 
							sniffing</a>. True, before browsers supported standards 
							correctly, sniffing was often a necessary way of coping 
							with their incompatibilities, but it never really worked 
							in the long run. No sooner did you finish uploading 
							your script than a new version of an old browser came 
							along to break it. The fragile, self-defeating nature 
							of browser sniffing was one of the forces behind the 
							rebellion that eventually brought standards to our browsers. 
							And here it was, I thought, being legitimized and enshrined 
							in the code base of a web browser.</p>
							<p>Primarily, though, I was bothered by version targeting 
							because it runs contrary to the principle of forward-compatible 
							development. This has been the best practice of our 
							industry for years now, a way-of-being learned the hard 
							way in the browser wars. We develop with an eye to the 
							future, using features that are widely and stably implemented 
							and only adding “cutting-edge” features when they don’t 
							impair use of the site—this last practice known as
							<a href="#">progressive enhancement</a>. One example 
							of this approach is the techniques described in “<a href="#">Going 
							To Print</a>”, which add URLs in printed pages for advanced 
							browsers but don’t prevent or break printing in less 
							capable browsers.</p>
							<p>With version targeting, the incentive to plan ahead, 
							to be forward-looking, is almost entirely destroyed. 
							Instead, the browser makes a promise to always be backwards 
							compatible. In effect, version targeting is like
							<a href="#">Time Machine</a> for web browsers. The idea 
							is that when <span class="caps">IE10</span> loads up 
							my <span class="caps">IE7</span> page, it rewinds itself 
							to act like <span class="caps">IE7</span> did, all those 
							years ago—no matter what changed in the meantime.</p>
							<p>Thus, as a developer, there’s no need to look beyond 
							the current state of browsers. I can just assume that 
							browsers will always support what I’ve done even if 
							it’s the worst kind of short-sighted, browser-specific, 
							who-needs-standards-anyway type of development possible. 
							And as for the expected direction of browser support 
							for <span class="caps">CSS</span> or JavaScript or
							<span class="caps">HTML5</span> or whatever…who cares?</p>
							<h2>Reality check</h2>
							<p>Well, who does care? The readers of <cite>A List 
							Apart</cite>, surely, and there are a great many of 
							us. But as <a href="#">survey</a> after <a href="#">
							analysis</a> shows, the vast majority of web content 
							is produced without much regard for standards-based, 
							forward-compatible principles.</p>
							<p>Yes, we have made great strides; yes, the work of 
							educating developers has borne some fruit. Still, we 
							need to be honest about this. We’re not reaching everyone, 
							and probably never will. Some sites will be developed 
							according to what the browser-of-the-moment does, no 
							matter how incorrect that might be in comparison to 
							a specification or even other browsers’ behaviors.</p>
							<p>This creates a dilemma for browser vendors when faced 
							with bugs in their implementations: fix it or preserve 
							it? The classic example of this was <a href="#">the 
							original implementation of <code>height</code> and
							<code>width</code> in Internet Explorer</a>, which was 
							wrong per the <span class="caps">CSS</span> specifications. 
							The IE team at the time became aware of this fairly 
							soon after they shipped it in <span class="caps">IE3</span>…and 
							yet the problem wasn’t fixed until
							<span class="caps">IE6</span>, a delay that slowed the 
							adoption of <span class="caps">CSS</span> and gave rise 
							to a whole family of JavaScript sniffers and
							<a href="#">CSS hacks</a>.</p>
							<p><a href="#"><code>DOCTYPE</code> switching</a> came 
							to the rescue there, of course, allowing
							<span class="caps">IE6</span> to preserve its old (wrong) 
							behavior in “quirks mode” and do the right thing in 
							“standards mode”—a mechanism introduced in
							<span class="caps">IE5</span> for the Macintosh and 
							quickly adopted by other browsers.</p>
							<p>Let’s consider that for a moment. With the <code>
							DOCTYPE</code> switch, web browsers effectively recognized 
							two version states: old and current. There was the way 
							things were done in Ye Olden Days, before <code>DOCTYPE</code> 
							switching, and the latest and greatest.</p>
							<h2>Speeding advances</h2>
							<p>So we already have an example of version targeting 
							in the <code>DOCTYPE</code> switch. Once I came to that 
							realization, my instincts were thrown into confusion. 
							After all, I was a big proponent of <code>DOCTYPE</code> 
							switching, and still rely on it to this day. Did I hate 
							this whole idea, or not?</p>
							<p>Like <code>DOCTYPE</code> switching did in 2000, 
							version targeting negates the vendor argument that existing 
							behaviors can’t be changed for fear of breaking web 
							sites. If <span class="caps">IE8</span> botches its 
							implementation of some <span class="caps">CSS</span> 
							property or <span class="caps">DOM</span> method, the 
							mistake can be fixed in <span class="caps">IE9</span> 
							without breaking sites developed in the
							<span class="caps">IE8</span> era.</p>
							<p>This actually makes browser vendors more susceptible 
							to pressure to fix their bugs, and less fearful of doing 
							so. That’s <em>huge</em>, as fundamentally game changing 
							as was <code>DOCTYPE</code> switching, but on an ongoing 
							basis. Just imagine how much sooner “<code>height</code>” 
							and “<code>width</code>” could have been fixed in IE, 
							had this mechanism been in place from the beginning.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, if this all works as advertised, it’s 
							eventually going to make web development a lot less 
							reliant on virtual machines. If you need to support 
							the current and previous versions of a browser, you 
							just change your <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> value 
							to the older version and see how things are—no copy 
							of <a href="#">VirtualPC</a> required. That won’t happen 
							right away, but it’s a reasonable eventual outcome.</p>
							<h2>The new sniff test</h2>
							<p>We’re over browser sniffing, though, aren’t we? Didn’t 
							somebody call it “fragile” and “self-defeating”? (Ahem.)</p>
							<p>Well, yes, but there are crucial differences between 
							“browser sniffing” as we know it and the proposed version 
							targeting. For one thing, “browser sniffing” at present 
							means “writing code to check what browser is being used 
							and make adjustments to the markup/CSS/JS/server response/whatever 
							accordingly.” Version targeting reverses that completely, 
							making it “the browser checking the page to see when 
							it was developed and making adjustments to its behavior 
							accordingly.” In other words, version targeting frees 
							web developers from sniffing and places the onus on 
							browser developers instead.</p>
							<p>That’s not a change to be lightly dismissed. Browser 
							implementors, for all they frustrate us with (often 
							justified) pleas of limited resources, still command 
							far more resources and expertise in regression testing 
							than any of us can muster. Furthermore, browser developers 
							have a far more vested interest in making sure the version 
							targeting works as promised and doesn’t break old sites 
							than site authors do in updating their old sites to 
							work in new browsers.</p>
							<h3>The benefits of hindsight</h3>
							<p>The second major difference between browser sniffing 
							and version targeting is that browser sniffing looks 
							forward while version targeting looks back. Looking 
							forward is one big reason browser sniffing is fragile: 
							it’s hard to predict the future. To pick one example, 
							Safari’s inclusion of “like Gecko” in its user-agent 
							identifier broke a fair number of sniffer scripts—even 
							those that were comparatively well done. The authors 
							of those scripts had simply failed to predict that a 
							non-Gecko browser from Apple would include the word 
							“Gecko” in its user-agent identifier.</p>
							<p>Now we have the prospect that browser sniffing will 
							be done by the browsers, and will look back. This is 
							inherently far more stable: the past is always a lot 
							easier to predict than the future.</p>
							<p>Besides which, we’ve written enough scripts and hacks 
							to make our pages adjust to browsers. Isn’t it about 
							time browsers started adjusting to our pages?</p>
							<h2>To sum up</h2>
							<p>We know forward-compatible development works. More 
							to the point, though, it’s all we’ve had. Since the 
							inception of the web, with the sole exception of
							<code>DOCTYPE</code> switching, browsers have been a 
							“what I do is what you get” proposition. Developers 
							have been forced to conform to past browsers’ behaviors 
							while making educated guesses about what future browsers 
							would do.</p>
							<p>Forward-compatible development and its cousin, progressive 
							enhancement, were necessary and proper because they 
							were the only hope we had of sites continuing to work 
							into the future. The mantra of forward compatibility 
							was necessitated by the world in which we worked.</p>
							<p>In a world where browsers had done version targeting 
							from the outset, there would have been another option. 
							Who knows what might have happened? Perhaps we’d find 
							the very idea of forward-compatible development hopelessly 
							fragile, even laughable.</p>
							<p>We say forward-compatible development is the mark 
							of a professional because that’s what the profession 
							demands. With the advent of version targeting, that 
							need may simply evaporate, rendered not wrong but moot. 
							And though my deeply-ingrained instincts still fight 
							that conclusion, I have to do my best to look at this 
							possible future and ask myself if it looks better or 
							worse than what we’ve known.</p>
							<p>It looks better.</p>
							<p>So in the end, and much to my surprise, it turned 
							out that I don’t hate the idea after all. Version targeting 
							allows browsers to much more easily develop new features 
							and fix bugs and shortcomings in existing features, 
							which has the potential to speed up the evolution of 
							web design and development. That alone is reason enough 
							to give it a chance.</p>
							<h2>Yes, but…</h2>
							<p>Of course, I still have concerns.</p>
							<p>The biggest concern is fidelity. Will the backwards-compatible 
							code for <span class="caps">IE8</span> always act exactly 
							like <span class="caps">IE8</span> did, or will there 
							be subtle changes that still break old sites? Might 
							there even be, dare we mention it, new bugs that affect 
							the backwards compatibility of future browsers? After 
							all, the door swings both ways: vendors might get lax 
							about their backward-looking code just as developers 
							might get lax about their forward-looking code. Talk 
							about irony.</p>
							<p>A small concern is the effect of version-targeting 
							code on the size of browser applications themselves. 
							Could this be a step toward browsers becoming bloatware? 
							Someone will chime in with “Who cares? Hard drives are 
							huge now!” but I remain solidly unconvinced by “resources 
							are cheap” arguments. No matter how cheap they are, 
							people still keep filling them up. I sincerely hope 
							the browser of the future won’t require a gigabyte or 
							two of storage space, chained to every previous version 
							of itself like Jacob Marley to his past misdeeds.</p>
							<h3>Terminology</h3>
							<p>I’m definitely not a fan of the “<code>edge</code>” 
							keyword. The reason for its existence seems to be so 
							that nobody has to hack their way around the targeting 
							mechanism with “<code>IE=1024</code>” or some other 
							large number. The problem is that providing a keyword 
							equivalent for that creates an aura of official blessing 
							that I don’t think Microsoft wants to give. It’s in 
							their interest to have everyone use this mechanism, 
							and the keyword acts as a wink and a nod to people who 
							want to avoid it. I’m all for people hacking around 
							the targeting mechanism if they want—I may well do it 
							myself—but that should be done with a hack, not an official 
							keyword.</p>
							<h3><code>DOCTYPE</code> as version targeting</h3>
							<p>I wish I could be happy about the way pages are handled 
							in the absence of any version-targeting information. 
							If a page doesn’t have any version-targting information, 
							then the <code>DOCTYPE</code> will be used as a proxy 
							for version targeting. For example, all the
							<span class="caps">HTML4</span> and
							<span class="caps">XHTML1 </span><code>DOCTYPE</code>s 
							will be targeted to <span class="caps">IE7</span> by 
							default. In the future, <span class="caps">HTML5
							</span><code>DOCTYPE</code>s might by default be targeted 
							to <span class="caps">IE9</span> or
							<span class="caps">IE10</span>, depending on how things 
							shake out.</p>
							<p>Of course, a developer can avoid all that by providing 
							an explicit browser version: an <span class="caps">HTML2</span> 
							document can be targeted to <span class="caps">IE9</span>; 
							an <span class="caps">HTML6</span> document can be targeted 
							to <span class="caps">IE7</span>. But in the absence 
							of explicit version-targeting information, the <code>
							DOCTYPE</code> will be used as a stand-in and map to 
							a specific version. From Microsoft’s point of view, 
							this is necessary: without this, untargeted pages could 
							be broken by new versions of IE. I get that. But it 
							means that in order to have pages handled they way they’ve 
							always been, essentially moving forward with browsers, 
							you have to hack around the targeting mechanism with 
							a really large version number—or the <code>edge</code> 
							keyword, if it doesn’t get dropped.</p>
							<p>The biggest challenge, it seems, will be to make 
							sure that version targeting is done in such a way that 
							it will work into the future and not break down over 
							time like <code>DOCTYPE</code> switching did. In other 
							words, we need to make sure it’s forward-compatible.</p>
							<p>I guess those instincts came in handy after all.</p>
